- **Capstone project at Brown (spring 2016)**

  My undergraduate capstone project at Brown was on verifying the solutions
to several epistemic logic puzzles in
the [Alloy programming language](http://alloy.mit.edu/alloy/).
The abstract is [here](/doc/brown-capstone-abstract.pdf).
You can also download the Alloy files and run them yourself;
they are [here](/doc/brown-capstone-files.zip).

- **Model theory (spring 2015)**

  With a group of 8 other students, I ran a group independent study project (GISP) course on Model Theory, in spring 2016.
The website for that course can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/a/brown.edu/model-theory-spring-2015).

  Here are some of the notes I wrote for that course:

  - [Notes on natural deduction](/doc/2015 model theory/lecture-8.pdf)

  - [Notes on filters and ultrafilters](/doc/2015 model theory/lecture-17.pdf)

  - [Notes on ultrapowers](/doc/2015 model theory/lecture-25.pdf)

  (The notes are mostly, but not entirely, free of errors.)
