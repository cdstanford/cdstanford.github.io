## About Me

Since Fall 2016, I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Pennsylvania.
I graduated from Brown University in May 2016 (Sc.B Mathematics Computer Science.)

Here is my [CV](/doc/CV.pdf) (out of date, I'll update it soon).

**Research interests.** In no particular order: formal verification, type systems, nonclassical logic (especially modal logics), automata theory, structural complexity theory. In general, I am interested in the applications of mathematical logic (e.g. finite model theory, set theory) to programming languages and verification. This list is incomplete.

I attend the [Penn PL Club](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~plclub/).

## Me Elsewhere

I organize and write problems for the [Utah Math Olympiad](http://www.utmath.org).
