I set up this blog to work with Facebook comments, using the advice [here](https://joshuacox.github.io/jekyll/2015/11/28/facebook-comments-and-jekyll/).
The major option for adding comments to a github site seems to be to use [Disqus](https://disqus.com/), but for some reason I have reservations about that.
I think possibly because I have never bothered to comment on anything which uses Disqus,
and I get the feeling it's not just me. On the other hand, their interface seems generally well-designed (for example, it makes it easy to login with social media) so idk if I have any objective complaints. Some [informal polling results](https://www.blogmarketingacademy.com/blog-comment-systems/) suggest Disqus may be slightly more popular than Facebook, but neither is as popular as having a native, more traditional looking comment form.

So maybe neither Facebook nor Disqus is the answer. I found some other options: [1](https://www.hawksworx.com/blog/adding-a-static-comments-system-to-my-jekyll-build/), [2](http://ivanzuzak.info/2011/02/18/github-hosted-comments-for-github-hosted-blogs.html).

The upshot is that while Facebook comments are set up and hopefully work (test them out below!), that could be a mistake on my part and may change soon.
I'm not really expecting too many comments in the meantime.
