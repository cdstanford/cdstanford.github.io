The major option for adding comments to a github site seems to be to use Disqus comments
([1](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21446165/how-do-i-use-disqus-comments-in-github-pages-blog-markdown)).
But I've never been a huge fan of them, maybe because I've never bothered to sign up for a Disqus account and I feel that asking others to do the same, they probably won't.

Today, October 16, 2016, marks the day I finally get a simple website and blog up and running. :)
The links in the sidebar should also be working. "About" being the most important of these.

I set up this site using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
Of course, I got help from some people.
I used [this github repository](https://github.com/maciakl/Sample-Jekyll-Site) as a template, and haven't modified the style and layout much (yet).

Here's my list of things to do next, in no particular order:

1. Set up a working comment system.

1. Get MathJax working with the site.

1. Get tags to work.

1. Mess with the CSS to make things a bit more pretty.
