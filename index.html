		<div class="entry"><p>One of the fun things about doing an internship at Microsoft has been all the puzzle-hunt related activities they run.
Yesterday, with a team of four, I participated in the <a href="https://safarilabs.solutions/">Puzzle</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Puzzle_Safari"> Safari</a>. Although a fully virtual event, it was one of the more fun puzzle hunts I’ve done. The safari is not just about solving puzzles; it mixes in different activities every time you solve a puzzle. Usually, you have to take some kind of photo in your home or outside it, but you can also go on a run, or a few activities were games inside a minecraft world. The photos worked out really well, first because of the creative challenge of many of them, and second because it offers a break from just sitting in front of a screen the whole time and forces you to get up and move around.</p>

<p>Great job to the organizers!</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>Last post about the tournament! This tournament has been a lot of fun. Previous post about round 7 (semifinals) is <a href="/2019/11/03/dominion-tournament-semifinals">here</a>.
I lost 2 to 4 and definitely misplayed, especially in game 4. I won games 2 and 5.</p>

<hr />

<p><em>For each kingdom, try to guess the most valuable cards, i.e. which cards are most important to the best strategy. For reference, a list of all Dominion cards can be found <a href="http://wiki.dominionstrategy.com/index.php/List_of_cards">here</a>. Good luck!</em></p>

<h3 id="game-1">Game 1</h3>

<p><img src="/img/2019/dominion-tournament-round8/kingdom1.png" alt="Kingdom 1" style="width: 80%" title="Kingdom 1" /></p>

<details>
<summary>Spoiler:</summary>

<p>Most valuable card(s): Jack of All Trades</p>

<p>Jack/Silver (or Jack/Merchant maybe) open is fiarly clear. From there, the right strategy here is probably just money-focused. I tried to do Conclave village with Diplomat, Werewolf, and Council Room (and a few other uniques), but it wasn't fast enough compared to money. Also, we both got nice Mint trashes at some point. Another question is whether you can try to go for a Feodum-based strategy, but probably it's still not fast enough.</p>

</details>

<h3 id="game-2">Game 2</h3>

<p><img src="/img/2019/dominion-tournament-round8/kingdom2.png" alt="Kingdom 2" style="width: 80%" title="Kingdom 2" /></p>

<details>
<summary>Spoiler:</summary>

<p>Most valuable card(s): Hamlet, Peddler, Triumph. Honorable Mention: Scheme, Bridge Troll.</p>

<p>Interesting board because there's cost reduction and gains, but no draw. So you can only hope to get about 5 gains on a given turn. However, the clear interaction is Peddler/Hamlet: if you can play, say, 4 Hamlets, then you can gain 5 Peddlers. So you want to try to get the entire Peddler stack.</p>

<p>I had some unlucky shuffles and my opponent got Scheme instead of Hamlets, which I didn't like at the time, but now I can see the value in an early Scheme or two; it helps line up actions for Peddler. Inventor on the open is good; one or two Bridge Trolls are good, but the deck can't support too many. Then you just Triumph a turn or two, and the game ends on 3-piles.</p>

</details>

<h3 id="game-3">Game 3</h3>

<p><img src="/img/2019/dominion-tournament-round8/kingdom3.png" alt="Kingdom 3" style="width: 80%" title="Kingdom 3" /></p>

<details>
<summary>Spoiler:</summary>

<p>Most valuable card(s): Diplomat, Lookout, Squire.</p>

<p>This one I'm less sure of. The question is whether a Jack/Money variant is just better than the engine, as it was in Game 1. I skipped Jack so I could trash more aggressively. I love Lookout here. But I lost  because I didn't get Diplomats quickly enough and so my opponent found a way to empty the remaining 4 diplomats in a turn. Squire goes well with Diplomat and becomes Giant when trashed with Lookout. Giant is what tipped the balance for me to want to play the engine.</p>

</details>

<h3 id="game-4">Game 4</h3>

<p><img src="/img/2019/dominion-tournament-round8/kingdom4.png" alt="Kingdom 4" style="width: 80%" title="Kingdom 4" /></p>

<details>
<summary>Spoiler:</summary>

<p>Most valuable card(s): Recruiter, Storeroom, Library. Maybe Charm.</p>

<p>I mainly want to just play with the first three cards, but you can play with most of the board here. Fishing Village for some actions (not as good as Recruiter for actions though, probably); Bandit for Golds which can be trashed; Charm is reasonable but I kinda disrespected it, and only opponent got them, I went heavily for Storeroom/Library. Mission could be good here; one of us should have gotten it (allows getting villagers, and paying off Royal Blacksmith debt). Apothecary could also be good early on and interacts with Storeroom nicely.</p>

</details>

<h3 id="game-5">Game 5</h3>

<p><img src="/img/2019/dominion-tournament-round8/kingdom5.png" alt="Kingdom 5" style="width: 80%" title="Kingdom 5" /></p>

<details>
<summary>Spoiler:</summary>

<p>Most valuable card(s): Haunted Woods, Cargo Ship, Throne Room.</p>

<p>My opponent went solely for Haunted Woods basically; I ended up winning playing the more interesting deck, with Throne Room, Lurker, Nomad Camp, and of course lots of Haunted Woods draw. Awkward and inconsistent but when you can get like 3 Haunted Woods plays in, you draw a LOT the next turn. The real challenge is doing this fast enough to catch up on the Battlefield points. Silk Roads end up being enough to outscore in the end.</p>

</details>

<h3 id="game-6">Game 6</h3>

<p><img src="/img/2019/dominion-tournament-round8/kingdom6.png" alt="Kingdom 6" style="width: 80%" title="Kingdom 6" /></p>

<details>
<summary>Spoiler:</summary>

<p>Most valuable card(s): Trader, Crop Rotation.</p>

<p>Not much else to do here but Trader/Money. It would be Soothsayer, but the problem is once you have a Trader or two, the opponent doesn't want to buy Soothsayer: it basically says "opponent gains a Silver", which actually helps them, and it's kinda slow for you. Crop Rotation is good and I slept on it a bit. There is also a trick you can do with Villa and Trader (that both of us seem to have missed): gain the Villa and then trash it for a lot of silvers.</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>After a close match against one of the very top seeded players going to game 7 tiebreaker, I finally lost a game! I will play one more match, to determine whether I get 3rd or 4th place. Previous post about round 6 (quarterfinals) is <a href="/2019/10/27/dominion-tournament-quarterfinals">here</a>.</p>

<p>I won games 2, 4, and 6. In Games 1 through 5 we played similar strategies and there was a fair amount of luck, but both of us made some definite misplays. In Game 6 I played a completely different strategy that seemed to win convincingly. In Game 7 I played significantly worse.</p>

<summary>Spoiler:</summary>

<p>Most valuable card(s): Encampment, Sentry, Dismantle.</p>

<p>Encampment is the only draw here, so I cared a lot about the split (there are only 5 Encampments to go around) and opened Encampment/Dismantle to get an early Gold. Dismantling Estates into Copper and Gold is usually bad, but I made an exception here in order to try activating Encampments early on. Then I aggressively bought Encampments in the following turns, with 1 Masquerade.</p>

<p>However my opponent had 5/2 and opened Sentry/Encampment, then playing Sentry on turns 3, 4, and 5 to become very well-trashed, which was just too strong. In response to this, I had to make risky Encampment plays, hoping to find Gold, but that didn't work out (after doing this twice, and I think it was necessary to risk, the Encampment split went from 3/2 to 1/4).</p>

<p>Some spectators didn't like the Dismantle opening but I think I still like it; getting the Encampment split 3 to 2 seems really valuable to me as it is the only draw, and if you can activate them early with Golds then they are not just dead cards in your deck. No one got Band of Misfits but with an early 5 (maybe the second 5, after Sentry) it is a very flexible terminal, it can be Masquerade, Amulet, or Dismantle, whichever is most useful at the time.</p>

<summary>Spoiler:</summary>

<p>Most valuable card(s): Recruiter, Tragic Hero, Bank.</p>

<p>You can (almost) ignore everything else here. I think Fishing Village is a trap; Actions look nice but the game doesn't last long enough, Silver is better for hitting price points. With Borrow, you open Recruiter, probably with Silver or Sage. Then you just aggressively buy the Tragic Hero stack. When a Tragic Hero pops, it becomes a Bank, and you buy several more Tragic Heros until they are gone. Then on your last turn you should have played several Tragic Heros, put several Banks in play, and had enough money for 5 Provinces. I won this. I was also always considering Junk Dealer but there's no time, and besides, trashing the coppers on a big turn hurts your economy since it reduces the value of Bank.</p>

<summary>Spoiler:</summary>

<p>Most valuable card(s): Highway, Counterfeit, Recruiter, Armory.</p>

<p>Highway is on the board and there's gains (Counterfeit and Armory), so this board is about getting lots of Highways and gaining 8 Provinces. Lots of things help along the way; Recruiter and Counterfeit are good trashing, Pooka helps a lot once you have a couple villagers saved, and Scrying Pool is really efficient draw.</p>

<p>Cursed Gold from Pooka makes the opening more interesting. I opened Recruiter/Armory on 5/4; opponent opened Recruiter/Oasis on 6/3. My Recruiter missed the second shuffle, but the Armory also didn't necessarily work out so well. My plan was to gain Potion with it and go for Scrying Pools, but based on the game I think maybe you wait a few turns to get Armory, once you can use it with Highway to gain 5s.</p>

<p><img src="/img/2019/dominion-tournament-round7/kingdom4.png" alt="Kingdom 4" style="width: 80%" title="Kingdom 4" /></p>

<summary>Spoiler:</summary>

<p>Most valuable card(s): Cursed Village, Storeroom, University, Recruiter.</p>

<p>So many Recruiter boards. This board also has the Cursed Village/Storeroom combo. Urchin is a trap I think; we both skipped it on the opening. The problem is if your Urchins don't collide you are very sad compared to someone who opens with Storeroom/Potion (for example) to make a smooth second shuffle buying University. And then once they have Cursed Villages, the discard attack doesn't hurt them and might help them. The Mercenary trashing is good for you, but it's not clear there is time for it.</p>

<p>I opened Storeroom/Silver and opponent opened Storeroom/Potion; then we both get 2 Universities, a Recruiter, and Cursed Villages and Storerooms (in some order). Recruiter makes Storeroom really nice because you can play it first if you don't have a Cursed Village in hand. I was ahead but almost lost this; my opponent had a pile-out but misplayed it. Maybe I also had a pile-out on the previous turn, but it was hard to say.</p>

<p>Most valuable card(s): Highway, Forager. Honorable Mention: Lost City and Courtyard.</p>

<p>Another Highway board with +Buy, so the goal is to get Highways and trash down with Forager, then buy 8 Provinces. I don't think I totally misplayed this, but my opponent built more efficiently and was ahead. I opened Forager/Silver because I want to hit 5 early, then bought a second Forager and third later. Opponent opened Jester/Courtyard (you have to buy something on 5/2 and Jester makes some sense). We both got 2 Lost Cities but I think only getting 1 might be OK here, Highway might just be better. Also you get Markets once you are trashed down and need the +Buy in place of Forager, but at that point the game is already basically over due to piles.</p>

<p>Most valuable card(s): Research, Treasure Trove, Counterfeit, Goons.</p>

<p>There are no actions, but Research is technically draw. It needs food to trash and set aside a lot of cards -- Gold is perfect for this, and Treasure Trove gains Golds. So you can combine these to play a deck which draws a lot of cards every turn (half the deck, roughly), and plays Goons hopefully every turn, and uses Counterfeit and Upgrade to trash extra Coppers and such.</p>

<p>The difficulty is that a money strategy should be very fast as well, just buying a lot of money cards with Counterfeit, Goons, Treasure Trove. This is what my opponent did, and also got Marauder to junk me, although it seems the Marauder wasn't too effective in the end (there is not enough time to play terminals other than Goons, I guess).</p>

<p>It was cool to see my more-interesting deck win in the end! I made some misplays but still bought enough points over two turns (3 provinces, 3 duchies, and an estate I believe). It was close, but if I had not misplayed, based on spectator comments, I think my deck strategy is a lot better and it would not have been close.</p>

<p>Most valuable card(s): Donate, Peasant, Artisan, Knights, Torturer.</p>

<p>I was player 1 on a Donate board, so I should be basically guaranteed to win this, but after an early unlucky draw on turn 5, I thought I was behind and some of my plays were quite questionable.</p>

<p>Turn 1 is buy Peasant and turn 2 is donate down to 4 coppers and a Peasant. Except if you have 5/2 you can Donate turn 1, buy Peasant turn 2 which is even better. Then you want Artisan as fast as possible. From here is where I messed up; I got Mystic instead of Artisan to be safe so that my shuffle was guaranteed, which seems reasonable, but then I got more Mystic and Shanty Town, basically as utility cards to line up shuffles when I should have just gone straight for Torturer and Acting Troupe to start drawing and attacking. My opponent got Torturer and Acting Troupe in play faster, with a couple Artisans and Disciple to gain stuff. From there, you get Knights, and once you play a few knights it's completely devastating. My deck was trashed down to 6 cards, and from there it is mainly trying desperate things in hopes of an early pile-out or something.</p>
