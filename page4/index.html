		<div class="entry"><h3 id="life-goal-dont-pull-any-more-all-nighters-for-work">Life goal: Don’t pull any more all-nighters for work.</h3>

<p>Sleep has always been a sort of ongoing personal experiment for me. In high school I wanted to try out a 28-hour sleep schedule (see <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Six-Days-a-Week/">1</a> <a href="https://limedaring.com/articles/hacking-your-week-the-28-hour-day/">2</a> <a href="http://echochamber.me/viewtopic.php?t=56415">3</a>), but never succeeded. In college, I like to believe I perfected the art of staying up all night. Specifically, I mean staying up all night and then timing my bed-time perfectly to set myself in course for an earlier sleep schedule than I had before.</p>

<p>Yes, I was so tired getting up in the mornings that I found it easier — often much easier — to stay up all night (with plenty of food and caffeine, and other tactics) rather than have to go to bed and force myself awake in the morning. If this doesn’t strike you as absurd, it should! Of course, these all-nighters were often more or less forced by the work I had to do, but they were also usually exciting and energizing. I loved the novelty of doing a project or activity late into the night, until the sun rises and longer.</p>

<p>Since then, my tendency to stay up late has become more of a liability. I don’t feel energized to pull all-nighters the way I used to. But at the same time, I still find myself caught in late sleep schedules, unable to feel awake in the morning, and unable to power through a full all-nighter to reset things.
Staying up for work has, as a result, become considerably more stressful and miserable.</p>

<p>This semester, I decided to see a doctor about my sleep patterns.
Apparently I have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_sleep_phase_disorder">Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder</a>.
The strategy for correcting (or just investigating) this starts by controlling for all possible negative influences (caffeine, inconsistent sleep, lack of association between bed and sleep, electronic screen time, and so on).
In the absence of these factors, you try to obtain a “normal” 24-hour schedule, and you push wake-up time back slowly over a period of weeks.
Finally, you start to experiment with which factors have the biggest effect by reintroducing them if necessary.
Since classes are over and there are no deadlines, this is the perfect time to be working on sleep, and it’s an exciting project.</p>

<p>Perhaps in a few months I will be back to my usual patterns.
That’s OK — it may be how I am happiest.
Staying up all night for fun or with the right work drive can be really wonderful.
But what I can’t do, and am not going to let myself do, is fail in planning my time so that staying up all night becomes the only possibility, instead of a decision. So, I’ve made that a life goal.</p>

<h3 id="unrelated-im-going-to-write-more-posts">Unrelated: I’m going to write more posts.</h3>

<p>I want to start writing in my blog more. I’m still a bit undecided on whether this is really a better idea than posting to Facebook. Especially since Facebook posts would probably get 10 to 100 times more views. But it’s a different kind of outlet, with different expectations and norms, and I want to try out using it consistently. I think it may have the possibility of being more free-form and more honest. When I post to Facebook I think too much about what my readers will think.</p>

<p>So my goal with the blog is to <strong>write down whatever I’ve been thinking about.</strong> And I also want to <strong>write more.</strong> I don’t want it to be polished, I just want to work on my writing and express my thoughts on things. Hopefully, by focusing on quantity instead of quality, I will start writing every week instead of every couple of months, and over time the quality will get better.</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>If you are familiar with theory of computation, perhaps you have caught yourself thinking of the relationship between NP and P as analagous to the relationship between RE and R.
That is, nondeterministic polynomial-time is to polynomial-time as Turing-recognizable is to Turing-decidable.
I certainly have thought this, and I think it’s because I visualize NP as a “positive” extension of P, with counterpart coNP,
just as RE is a “positive” extension of R with counterpart coRE.</p>

<p>On the face of it, this rather seems like a misconception.
NP is formed from P by introducing nondeterminism, whereas RE is formed from R by introducing
non-halting behavior, and these are quite different concepts.
In particular, if we add non-halting behavior to poly-time TMs, by requiring only that
the TM runs in poly-time <em>if it halts at all</em>, we still only obtain the class of languages P.
And on the other hand, non-deterministic TMs are equivalent to deterministic TMs (see e.g. Sipser 2nd edition, Theorem 3.16), so adding non-determinism to decider TMs we expect to remain at the class of languages R.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/38536341/2038713">this ignored stackoverflow answer</a> claims a very close analogy in terms of verifiers, where just as NP is the class of languages with polynomial-time verifiers, RE is the class of languages which have verifiers at all.
In fact this is true, but only if we allow the runtime of the verifier to be unbounded in the length of the original input, which seems like cheating considering that the runtime of a poly-time verifier must be <em>uniformly</em> bounded by a poly-time function in the length of the original input.</p>

<p>At the core of the problem is the definition of <em>runtime</em> and <em>halting / non-halting</em> for nondeterministic and verifier TMs.
I summarize the discussion with the following table:</p>

<table style="width:90%;">
  <tr>
    <th>Model</th>
    <th>Polynomial bound</th> 
    <th>Finite bound</th> 
    <th>Halting</th> 
    <th>No bound</th>
  </tr>
  <tr> <td>         TM</td> <td> P</td> <td>R</td> <td> R</td> <td>RE</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> Nondet. TM</td> <td>NP</td> <td>R</td> <td> R</td> <td>RE</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>Verifier TM</td> <td>NP</td> <td>R</td> <td>RE</td> <td>RE</td> </tr>
</table>

<!-- Older plain-text / markdown table
|    Model    | polynomial bound | finite bound | halting | no bound |
|:-----------:|:----------------:|:------------:|:-------:|:--------:|
|      TM     |         P        |       R      |    R    |    RE    |
|  Nondet. TM |        NP        |       R      |    R    |    RE    |
| Verifier TM |        NP        |       R      |    RE   |    RE    | -->

<p>Given this, I think the correspondence between P : NP and R : RE is essentially a fluke,
only present if we use verifiers rather than NTMs and if we only require that they halt,
not that their runtime has a finite bound.
The rest of this post just elaborates on and explains the above table.</p>

<h3 id="non-determinism-and-verifiers-in-general">Non-determinism and verifiers, in general</h3>

<p>It is perhaps clearer to think of these concepts in the most general setting.
Therefore, let us suppose that a <em>model of computation</em>
begins with a collection of <em>machines</em>, a collection of possible <em>inputs</em>,
and a collection of possible <em>configurations</em>.
For any machine <script type="math/tex">M</script> and input <script type="math/tex">w</script>, there is an <em>initial configuration</em> —
e.g. for TMs it would be the tuple of the machine <script type="math/tex">M</script>, the initial state <script type="math/tex">q_0</script>, and the initial tape containing <script type="math/tex">w</script>.
Then we have a <em>step function</em> (or “small-step semantics”) which maps any configuration to a new configuration,
taking one unit of time.
Lastly there are some <em>final configurations</em>, which do not step.
The evaluation of <script type="math/tex">M</script> on some input <script type="math/tex">w</script> (i.e., the “big-step semantics”)
is the final configuration that is ultimately produced by a sequence of small-steps, if it exists.
Moreover, let’s simplify this so that the output is binary, by saying that all final configurations either <em>accept</em> or <em>reject</em>.</p>

<p>A <em>nondeterministic model of computation</em> is the same but the small-step semantics can map a configuration to multiple possible configurations.
In this case, <script type="math/tex">M</script> accepts input <script type="math/tex">w</script> if it is <em>possible</em> to arrive at an accepting configuration.
(A discussion for another day is whether there are other reasonable definitions of the language of an NTM. Since there are many possible final configurations, we clearly need some way to aggregate all the configurations into one, and so it is natural to define some outputs to override others. In the standard definition we take accepting to override rejecting. But we could also take, for instance, non-halting behavior to override accepting!)</p>

<p>A <em>verifier model of computation</em> consists of an underlying model of computation, in which inputs are ordered pairs. A verifier machine <script type="math/tex">\text{ver}(M)</script> starts by mapping the input <script type="math/tex">x</script> to a new input <script type="math/tex">(x,w)</script>, where <script type="math/tex">w</script> is the witness, feeding that to <script type="math/tex">M</script>. We formally say that <script type="math/tex">\text{ver}(M)</script> accepts <script type="math/tex">x</script> if <em>there exists a witness</em> <script type="math/tex">w</script> for which <script type="math/tex">M</script> accepts <script type="math/tex">(x,w)</script>.</p>

<h3 id="runtime-bounds-for-non-deterministic-and-verifier-tms">Runtime bounds for non-deterministic and verifier TMs</h3>

<p>To obtain <script type="math/tex">NP</script> from <script type="math/tex">P</script>, we have to understand how to bound the runtime of a verifier (VTM) or nondeterministic TM (NTM) by a polynomial.
In general, the runtime of a verifier or NTM must be a notion that does not depend on the particular
branch executed, or the particular witness string.</p>

<p>If <script type="math/tex">f(n)</script> is some general function of <script type="math/tex">n</script>, we can say that an NTM’s runtime is bounded by <script type="math/tex">f(n)</script> if, on any input of size <script type="math/tex">n</script>, there is no branch with length longer than <script type="math/tex">f(n)</script> (including non-halting branches).
A VTM’s runtime is bounded by <script type="math/tex">f(n)</script> if, on any input of size <script type="math/tex">n</script> and any witness,
the runtime is bounded by <script type="math/tex">f(n)</script>.</p>

<p>Using this definition, if we require <script type="math/tex">f</script> to be a polynomial, then NTMs and VTMs both give us NP.
And then if we allow <script type="math/tex">f</script> to return any finite value (so, the runtime has to be bounded by a fixed function of the input),
then both NTMs and VTMs give us R.
The constant bound on the runtime means that we can simply try all possible branches
or all possible witnesses with a deterministic TM, and that TM will always halt.</p>

<p>But the difference between NTMs and VTMs arises if we formally require the strict bound <script type="math/tex">f(n) = \infty</script>. What this is saying is that all branches of the NTM are halting, and that the VTM halts on every input, witness pair. For NTMs, we can still simulate this with a deterministic TM, because if all branches of an NTM are halting, then we can try all of them and we will eventually halt.
But for a VTM, we cannot try all witnesses, because there are infinitely many! It does not really matter that the VTM
halts on each individual one.
With a VTM, requiring the TM to always halt is no barrier to us checking a Turing-recognizable but not decidable property, because we get an existential quantification over <em>all finite strings</em> (an infinite set) for free.</p>

<p>So we can say that RE is the set of languages recognized by a verifier
TM which always halts.
But this is somewhat dubious because maybe the “right” definition of the runtime of a verifier TM is the <em>supremum</em> over all witnesses, in which case a verifier for a language in RE but not in R will have runtime <script type="math/tex">\infty</script>.
And maybe the right definition of a halting verifier is one whose runtime is finite.
Under this definition, the subtle difference between NTMs and VTMs, highlighted in the original table, would disappear.</p>

<h3 id="references">References</h3>

<p>My definition of a decider / halting NTM does agree with Sipser 2nd edition, page 152, where he requires that a decider NTM halt on all branches. Sipser page 255 only defines the runtime for decider NTMs.
<a href="http://cs.stackexchange.com/q/6253/24088">This CS stackexchange thread</a> also gives several different definitions of a nondeterministic decider, which are all equivalent and recognize R.
As for verifiers, on Sipser page 265 it is suggested (but only really for the polynomial case) that the runtime for verifiers should be the supremum over all witnesses.</p>

<p>In descriptive complexity, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fagin's_theorem">Fagin’s theorem</a>
shows that NP arises from P
essentially by allowing existentially-quantified second-order variables.
On the other hand, RE arises from R by allowing existential quantification over <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{N}</script>.</p>

<p><a href="http://cs.stackexchange.com/q/33892/24088">This old CS stackexchange question</a> seems to me a great question which is asking what I asked, but its answer does not really say anything.
<a href="http://tau-cm2013.wikidot.com/forum/t-674853/re-r-co-re-p-np-co-np">This post in hebrew</a> might be mildly relevant but I can’t read it.</p>
