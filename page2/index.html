		<div class="entry"><p>If you’re familiar with the <a href="https://coq.inria.fr/">Coq proof assistant</a>, you may recognize their logo (a brown rooster shape). However, it’s difficult to find a good (high-resolution) image of their logo online — the <a href="https://coq.inria.fr/files/barron_logo.png">image file on their website</a> is a sad 66x100 pixels. Probably not good enough for use in a presentation or poster.</p>

<p>I made a vector version of the image (actually in September 2017) which I’m posting online now. This was made in <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>. The lines may differ very slightly from the original logo. I hope someone finds this useful!</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>It happens to be an appropriate day of the year to share this short and elegant puzzle game: <a href="https://jonathanwhiting.com/coding/traal/"><em>Traal</em></a> by <a href="http://www.draknek.org/">Alan Hazelden</a> and <a href="https://jonathanwhiting.com/">Jonathan Wighting</a>. (Also, if you like difficult elegant puzzle games, check out Alan Hazelden’s page. <em>A Good Snowman Is Hard To Build</em> is probably one of my favorite puzzle games on Steam.)</p>

<p>Actually, the reason I’m posting isn’t just to share some cool puzzle games; it’s because I googled for the deciphered texts of the scrolls in Traal, and couldn’t find anyone who had posted them. So, here they are (spoilers below).</p>

<p>There are 11 scrolls in the game. Here is what a scroll looks like:</p>

<details>
<summary>Spoiler:</summary>

<p> 1. THE LAST PERSON TO FIND THIS WAS IMPALED WHILE GETTING OUT. </p>
<p> 2. BEWARE STRANGER THIS IS AN EVIL PLACE NO GOOD WILL HAPPEN HERE. </p>
<p> 3. ONLY A FOOL WOULD SUFFER GREAT DANGER FOR LITTLE GAIN. </p>
<p> 4. THESE SCROLLS WILL NOT HELP YOU THEY EXIST FOR MY AMUSEMENT ALONE. </p>
<p> 5. SOMETIMES ONE WILL SEE MORE WHEN ONE ONLY LOOKS AHEAD. </p>
<p> 6. BROKEN GLASS CUTS DEEP AND NOTHING HERE CAN FIX IT. </p>
<p> 7. THREE WISE EYES SEE NO EVIL SEE NO EVIL AND SEE NO EVIL. </p>
<p> 8. EVIL TWINS ARE TWINS IN EVIL. </p>
<p> 9. WHEN ALL EVIL FACES YOU WEAR ONLY DARKNESS. </p>
<p> 10. AN END AWAITS YOU BEYOND HERE BUT IT IS NOT A PRETTY ONE. </p>
<p> 11. WHATEVER YOU DO DO NOT COLLECT ALL OF THESE SCROLLS A TERRIBLE FATE AWAITS. </p>

<p> All of the messages are related directly to the rooms they are in, except for scrolls 2 and 4: </p>

<p> 1. This is the scroll hidden behind the fake spikes and spike maze. Hence the (accurate) message about getting impaled on the way out.</p>
<p> 3. This is the scroll in the optional side room. Hence, "great danger for little gain". </p>
<p> 5. This is in the crossroads room that you can get through by only walking ahead. </p>
<p> 6. This scroll is blocked behind a bunch of glass that you have to break. </p>
<p> 7. This is in the room with three mushroom-shaped enemies ("three wise eyes") </p>
<p> 8. This is in the room with two mushroom-shaped enemies ("twins"). </p>
<p> 9: This is in the room that requires a blindfold to get past (blindfold = "wear only darkness"). </p>
<p> 10 and 11: These two are in the room just before the end, so they warn you about your fate.</p>

<p>The scrolls are just cryptograms (each English letter is represented as a certain symbol). So you can solve them with an online cryptogram solver, but the time-consuming part is reading the symbols and writing down an arbitrary letter for each symbol, so that you can input that into a solver. Also, the words on the scrolls wrap from one line to the next, so you have to figure out which line breaks to remove.</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>Here are my Round 2 games for the <a href="https://dominion.games">Dominion Online</a> tournament. I lost all 4 of these, and made a few dumb mistakes, but it is always illuminating to play against a higher-ranked player. The format will be the same as in <a href="/2018/09/18/dominion-tournament-round1/">my Round 1 post</a>: after looking at each board, you can click to see my picks for most valuable card(s), as well as a summary of the game.</p>

<p>In general, the boards were simpler compared to Round 1. (For instance, there were no landmarks.) In most cases, I think the deck I was aiming for was fine, but I need to work on optimizing my purchases to get there more efficiently and reliably.</p>

<p>For reference, a list of all Dominion cards can be found <a href="http://wiki.dominionstrategy.com/index.php/List_of_cards">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="game-1">Game 1</h3>

<p><img src="/img/2018/dominion-tournament-round2/kingdom1.png" alt="Kingdom 1" style="width: 100%" title="Kingdom 1" /></p>

<details>
<summary>Spoiler:</summary>

<p>Most valuable card(s): I argue Port, because the stack depletes very easily and there is no other +Actions. Whoever wins the pile can build a bigger engine. Then you need Trading Post (for trashing), Royal Blacksmith (for +Cards), and Sacred Grove (for +Buy). Maybe a Hireling. The big question is: is it worth getting Ironworks to help win the Port split?</p>

<p> Our general strategies were similar: get Trading Post as soon as possible, then aim for 5-7 Ports, 2-3 Sacred Groves, and 3-4 Royal Blacksmiths. Because Trading Post trashes Coppers, Royal Blacksmith quickly becomes very efficient draw.</p>

<p>But I opened Ironworks/Silver, while my opponent never got Ironworks. I wanted to get ahead on Ports. I did win the split (7 to 5 copies), but it didn't ultimately make the difference. We each got to 3 Provinces a turn, but my opponent could do this 1 turn earlier, and with limited +Buy I could not respond to this by switching to Duchies or Tunnels. So I had to just get 3 Provinces and hope my opponent drew a dud hand (which they did not).</p>

<p>If I could play this again, I might try to get the Port split more aggressively. If I had won it 8 to 4 instead of 7 to 5, it seems like it would have hurt my opponent's engine significantly. With only 4 Port you can only play 5 terminal actions, and you want at least 3 Royal Blacksmith, which leaves the remaining 2 to Sacred Grove, and none left for Trading Post.</p>

<p>My opponent had a speed boost from 5-2 split (opened Trading Post), but I went first. Also, they got a Hireling and I got a Jester. The Jester was likely a mistake compared to another Sacred Grove, as limited +Buy seriously hurts in the endgame. </p>

<h3 id="game-2">Game 2</h3>

<p><img src="/img/2018/dominion-tournament-round2/kingdom2.png" alt="Kingdom 2" style="width: 100%" title="Kingdom 2" /></p>

<summary>Spoiler:</summary>

<p>Most valuable card(s): Apprentice mainly. With Forum and Courtier+Skulk. </p>

<p>We both opened Skulk/Silver, and then went for Apprentice and Courtier. Courtier, of course, is "+3 coins, +1 action, gain a Gold" when Skulk is in hand. If you don't have enough Actions you can always just buy Villa. Apprentice is very strong as the only trashing, and also due to the frequent Gold-gaining. My main mistakes, however, were: (i) never getting Forum, (ii) not getting enough Apprentices (and not getting them early enough).</p>

<p>Basically, I had way too many stop cards and not enough Apprentices to deal with them. And Forum is really valuable to find Apprentice in a junky deck. So even when I used Apprentice on Gold, I would often drew a hand full of stop cards, and my last two turns were only stop cards.</p>

<p>Other than that, Skulk created some nasty swings with the usual suspect Hexes (Delusion and Envy). My opponent got an early procession, which seems pretty effective on Skulk (double hex, then gain Forum or Apprentice).</p>

</details>

<h3 id="game-3">Game 3</h3>

<p><img src="/img/2018/dominion-tournament-round2/kingdom3.png" alt="Kingdom 3" style="width: 100%" title="Kingdom 3" /></p>

<details>
<summary>Spoiler:</summary>

<p>Most valuable card(s): Masquerade of course. With Fishing Village, Hamlet, and Conspirator. But then you augment this with one of the following: Tactician, Stables, or even Jack of All Trades. And I'm not sure which is best.</p>

<p>This was the closest game. We both opened Masquerade/Fishing Village and got Hamlets and Conspirators; but my opponent went for 2 Stables, and I went for double Tactician. Sadly, I made a major mistake at one point by failing to save a card before playing Tactician -- forgot you have to discard at least one :(. The game ended early due to 3-piling (Hamlet, Fishing Village, Conspirator), but the VP difference was very close.</p>

<p>My hunch is that Tactician is better than Stables here. You don't want to go for both (since Stables needs some treasure), but Fishing Village is stronger than Silver and you get rid of all your Coppers anyway. That makes Tactician basically "+5 cards, +1 buy next turn". Then you spam Fishing Village and Conspirator, also Hamlet for +Buy.</p>

<p>Neither of us tried Jack of All Trades. It might be pretty good with Fishing Village and Hamlet. It would be an alternative to both Tactician and Stables. You don't really want the Silvers, though.</p>

</details>

<h3 id="game-4">Game 4</h3>

<p><img src="/img/2018/dominion-tournament-round2/kingdom4.png" alt="Kingdom 4" style="width: 100%" title="Kingdom 4" /></p>

<summary>Spoiler:</summary>

<p>Most valuable card(s): Probably Training + Market Square + Goons.</p>

<p>So, we both opened Market Square, but for some reason I thought I could get Remake instead of Chapel. Well, even though Remake is very efficient trashing (and gains Fishing Village or Market Square for the trouble), it turns out Chapel is definitely more efficient. I ultimately put Training on Fishing Village, while my opponent put Training on Market Square, which was a better plan in hindsight. We both had a few Werewolves for +Cards and a 3-pile ending was imminent, but due to the slower opening I didn't have any Goons yet. So my opponent ended the game very quickly (turn 12) by taking the Estate pile with Goons, 16 coins, and 8 buy.</p>
